## Scope

In scope:
- Sandbox escapes (Landlock, seccomp, namespace bypasses)
- Privilege escalation via compartment-user or compartment-root
- Environment variable injection past the sanitize filter
- Profile parsing bugs that weaken the intended policy
- Shell-replacement mode bypasses

Out of scope:
- Bugs in the Linux kernel itself (report to kernel security team)
- Attacks requiring pre-existing root access on the host
- Denial of service against the sandboxed process (not a goal)

## Known Limitations

See the [README](README.md) disclaimer and [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for
documented limitations, including:

- No formal verification or professional penetration testing
- Network egress bypass testing not yet automated for sandbox.sh HARD mode
- compartment-root not tested under actual root (test suite runs rootless)
